Direct Alignment with Human Preferences:
Example: OpenAI’s RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) fine-tunes models like ChatGPT by using human ratings to adjust responses so they better match what users expect.

Balancing Multiple Objectives:
Example: In InstructGPT, the reward function is designed to weigh factors such as helpfulness, safety, and factual accuracy, ensuring that no single criterion dominates the model’s output.

Sequential Decision-Making:
Example: For multi-turn conversations, RL helps the model decide whether to ask clarifying questions or provide direct answers, optimizing the dialogue flow over several turns.

Adaptive Improvement:
Example: Continuous learning from user interactions—like updating the model based on “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” feedback—enables the system to evolve its responses in real time.

Mitigating Pitfalls:
Example: Reward shaping is used to discourage generic or overly safe responses (mode collapse) by penalizing repetitive patterns and encouraging diverse, context-aware outputs.
