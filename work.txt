Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is typically performed before applying RLHF because it serves as an essential “warm start” or initialization step for the language model. Here are the main reasons why SFT is needed before RLHF:

Stable Initialization:
SFT refines a large, pre-trained language model using high-quality, human-curated prompt–response pairs. This process nudges the model’s output distribution toward responses that are already aligned with human preferences. Starting RL from a model that is already somewhat aligned makes the subsequent reinforcement learning phase (which is inherently noisier and more unstable) much more tractable.

Efficient Learning:
RL algorithms—especially those based on policy gradients like PPO—can be highly sample-inefficient if applied to a model that is still producing mostly random or unhelpful outputs. SFT helps the model produce coherent, contextually relevant responses so that when human feedback is used to generate reward signals, those signals are meaningful and informative.

Safety and Quality Control:
By fine-tuning on human-written examples, SFT guides the model to avoid generating harmful or off-topic responses. This “safety net” is crucial because the reward model (used in RLHF) and the RL update are both based on the quality of the responses. A poorly fine-tuned model might exploit loopholes in the reward function, leading to undesirable outputs.

Reduced Variance and Catastrophic Forgetting:
SFT helps the model converge to a baseline that captures essential aspects of human language and task-specific behaviors. This helps reduce the variance in the policy’s responses and minimizes the risk that RL updates will push the model too far from a safe and useful behavior, which could otherwise lead to catastrophic forgetting of the base language skills.

In Short
SFT prepares the model: It brings a broadly pre-trained model closer to human expectations by exposing it to high-quality, human-curated data.
It stabilizes RLHF: With a well-aligned starting point, the reinforcement learning phase (using human feedback through a reward model) becomes more stable, efficient, and less prone to drastic, unsafe changes.
Safety and Efficiency: SFT helps ensure that when the model is further refined via RLHF, it continues to generate responses that are not only high quality but also aligned with human values, while avoiding pitfalls like reward hacking.

Thought for a second
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is an essential first step because it teaches the model to generate human-like responses by directly mimicking high-quality, human-curated examples. However, there are several limitations of SFT that motivate the use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):

Static vs. Dynamic Optimization:
SFT trains the model on a fixed dataset of prompt–response pairs. This means the model is only as good as the examples it’s seen; it learns to mimic those examples without truly "understanding" the nuanced trade-offs between different possible responses. RLHF, on the other hand, uses a reward model that captures human judgments on the fly. By providing iterative feedback, RLHF lets the model dynamically adjust its behavior to optimize for subjective qualities like helpfulness, safety, and alignment with human values.

Reward Specification and Subjectivity:
While SFT relies on a static set of examples, it doesn't directly encode the human preferences or the "why" behind why one response is better than another. RLHF addresses this by collecting human comparisons (e.g., “response A is better than response B”) and training a reward model that quantifies those preferences. This reward signal can capture subtle qualities (e.g., tone, clarity, factual accuracy) that are hard to define in a supervised dataset.

Handling Ambiguity and Trade-Offs:
Many tasks—like content moderation, summarization, or answering open-ended questions—involve complex, ambiguous criteria. Two responses might be correct in different ways, but humans have preferences over style, length, or additional context. SFT cannot easily resolve such trade-offs because it only sees one “ideal” response per prompt. RLHF, by contrast, allows the model to learn from pairwise comparisons and optimize its policy so that it better reflects the nuanced, sometimes conflicting, criteria provided by human feedback.

Safety and Robustness:
SFT may cause a model to generate responses that are safe on average but still occasionally produce problematic or hallucinated content. RLHF introduces an additional safety layer through its reward model, which is explicitly trained to penalize outputs that do not meet human safety and alignment standards. This helps the model avoid extreme deviations from acceptable behavior that might arise if it were trained solely in a supervised manner.

Iterative Improvement:
The RLHF process is iterative. It continuously refines the model based on fresh human feedback, which is especially valuable in real-world scenarios where the context and user expectations might change over time. SFT, being a one-off process, does not offer this continuous loop of improvement.

In summary, while SFT provides a solid baseline for generating human-like text, RLHF is used to overcome its limitations by incorporating dynamic, iterative human feedback. This process fine-tunes the model further, optimizing it for nuanced human preferences and ensuring safer, more robust, and aligned outputs.
