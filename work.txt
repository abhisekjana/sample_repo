sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is a widely used metric for evaluating the accuracy of time series forecasting models. It measures the relative difference between the actual values and the forecasted values, expressed as a percentage. Unlike traditional Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), sMAPE is symmetric, meaning it penalizes over-forecasting and under-forecasting equally. The formula for sMAPE is:

sMAPE is bounded between 0% and 200%, with lower values indicating better model performance. It is especially useful for datasets where the scale of the time series can vary, as it normalizes the error b
y the magnitude of the values. However, it can be sensitive to small actual values, which may inflate the percentage error.

"I had the pleasure of working with [Coworker's Name] during our recent hackathon, and her contributions were outstanding. As a proactive and highly skilled UI developer, she not only completed the UI but also added several features that significantly enhanced our project. She demonstrated excellent collaboration throughout, providing continuous support to the team and ensuring we stayed on track. Additionally, she recorded an amazing demo that showcased our project beautifully. Her responsibility and diligence in completing all assigned objectives made her an invaluable team member. I would absolutely love the opportunity to work with her again in the future!"
