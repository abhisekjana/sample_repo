sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is a widely used metric for evaluating the accuracy of time series forecasting models. It measures the relative difference between the actual values and the forecasted values, expressed as a percentage. Unlike traditional Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), sMAPE is symmetric, meaning it penalizes over-forecasting and under-forecasting equally. The formula for sMAPE is:

sMAPE is bounded between 0% and 200%, with lower values indicating better model performance. It is especially useful for datasets where the scale of the time series can vary, as it normalizes the error b
y the magnitude of the values. However, it can be sensitive to small actual values, which may inflate the percentage error.

I had the pleasure of working with = during our recent hackathon, and I can't speak highly enough of her contributions. She is an incredibly proactive and talented UI developer, who not only completed the UI but went above and beyond by adding several additional features that really enhanced our project. Throughout the hackathon, she was consistently collaborative, always available for discussions, and stayed fully engaged with the team. Her responsibility and diligence in meeting all objectives were truly impressive. ~ is a fantastic team asset, and I would be thrilled to work with her again in the future!
