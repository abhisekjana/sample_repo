AI Alignment in LLMs refers to ensuring language models act in accordance with human values, intentions, and ethical principles. It involves training models to generate helpful, honest, and harmless outputs while avoiding harmful behaviors (e.g., bias, misinformation, toxicity). Techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and adversarial testing are used to align model behavior with desired goals. The challenge lies in balancing robustness, fairness, and adaptability across diverse contexts and user intents.
