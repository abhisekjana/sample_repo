a. For Change Point Detection:
You could use the encoder outputs (e.g., hidden states from the model) and fine-tune on a labeled dataset with known change points.
Alternatively, use techniques like density estimation or statistical tests on the learned embeddings to spot significant shifts.
b. For Anomaly Detection:
Use the modelâ€™s forecasting residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values) as indicators for anomalies. Large residuals would signal potential anomalies.
Fine-tune a classifier based on the hidden states of your encoder to recognize anomalous sequences by using a threshold-based method or clustering methods.
