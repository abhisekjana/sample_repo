sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is a widely used metric for evaluating the accuracy of time series forecasting models. It measures the relative difference between the actual values and the forecasted values, expressed as a percentage. Unlike traditional Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), sMAPE is symmetric, meaning it penalizes over-forecasting and under-forecasting equally. The formula for sMAPE is:

sMAPE is bounded between 0% and 200%, with lower values indicating better model performance. It is especially useful for datasets where the scale of the time series can vary, as it normalizes the error by the magnitude of the values. However, it can be sensitive to small actual values, which may inflate the percentage error.
