Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is a method that replaces human preference labels in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with AI-generated feedback. Instead of humans ranking responses, an AI model evaluates and ranks them based on predefined ethical principles, such as those in a "constitution." The AI-generated rankings train a preference model (PM), which is then used as a reward signal in reinforcement learning. This allows for scalable and consistent AI alignment without the need for extensive human supervision. RLAIF is particularly useful for enforcing safety and harmlessness in AI systems while maintaining helpfulness. It reduces bias introduced by human annotators and ensures that training objectives remain transparent and interpretable. However, the approach also introduces risks, as AI-generated feedback may reinforce subtle biases from pretraining data. Despite these challenges, RLAIF represents a promising step toward more autonomous and scalable AI alignment.
